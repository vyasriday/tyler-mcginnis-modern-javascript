### var, let and const 

#### var
* variables declared using var are function scoped
* initialized to undefined and can be accessed before variable declaration
#### let and const 
* variables declared using var and const are also hoisted, but they are not initialzed before their declaration and hence reference error when accessing them before declaration
* they are block scoped
